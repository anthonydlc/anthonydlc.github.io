## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs 

* Lab 1

  I liked lab one because I got to know my classmates a bit more and also my professors. It was my first lab so I didnâ€™t know what to expect from it. I still enjoyed it alot. 

* Lab 2

  The coding was overwhelming at first but with my partner I managed to get more comfortable with it. Having a partner made me feel less worried about the coding and helped me focus on it. 

* Lab 4

  This lab was a lot harder than the previous ones, I had to ask my classmates for help and they were nice enough to help me. Both my partner and I completed it.
